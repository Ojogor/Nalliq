# Map Filter Enhancement Implementation

## Overview
The map filtering functionality has been fully implemented by extending the MapUser class with the required properties for comprehensive filtering.

## Enhanced MapUser Class

### New Properties Added:
- `userType: String?` - Identifies user types ('community', 'food_bank', or null for regular users)
- `availableCategories: List<String>?` - List of food categories the user has available
- `trustScore: double?` - User's trust rating for filtering by minimum rating
- `isFriend: bool?` - Whether this user is a friend of the current user

### Factory Constructor:
```dart
factory MapUser.fromFirestore(String id, Map<String, dynamic> data, UserLocation userLocation)
```
Creates MapUser instances from Firestore documents with all filtering properties.

## Filter Implementation

### 1. Distance Filtering ✅
**Status**: Fully implemented and working
- Filters users within a specified radius (1-50km)
- Uses `FirebaseLocationService.calculateDistance()` for accurate calculations

### 2. User Type Filtering ✅ 
**Status**: Newly implemented
- **Community**: Shows users marked as 'community' type or regular users (null)
- **Friends**: Shows only users marked as friends (`isFriend: true`)
- **Food Banks**: Shows only users marked as 'food_bank' type
- **All**: Shows all users (default)

### 3. Item Category Filtering ✅
**Status**: Newly implemented
- Filters users based on categories of items they have available
- Uses `availableCategories` list to match against selected `ItemCategory`
- Categories: fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, meat, canned, beverages, snacks, spices, other

### 4. Rating Filtering ✅
**Status**: Newly implemented
- Filters users by minimum trust score
- Uses `trustScore` property to filter users with ratings >= selected minimum
- Range: 0.0 to 5.0 stars

## Data Requirements

### Firestore User Document Structure
For full filtering functionality, user documents should include:

```json
{
  "displayName": "User Name",
  "profilePictureUrl": "https://...",
  "userType": "community", // optional: "community", "food_bank", or null
  "availableCategories": ["fruits", "vegetables", "dairy"], // optional
  "trustScore": 4.5, // optional: 0.0 - 5.0
  "isFriend": false, // optional: determined by friendship status
  "location": {
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "latitude": 47.5615,
    "longitude": -52.7126,
    // ... other location fields
  }
}
```

## Filter UI Features

### Filter Button
- Shows count of active filters as a red badge
- Changes color to green when filters are active
- Located at bottom-right of map screen

### Filter Bottom Sheet
- **Distance Slider**: 1-50km range with real-time preview
- **User Type Chips**: Toggle between All, Community, Friends, Food Banks
- **Category Grid**: Select from all available food categories
- **Rating Slider**: 0.0-5.0 star minimum rating
- **Apply/Clear Actions**: Apply filters or clear all at once

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Filtering
- Filters are applied in memory after data loading
- Distance calculations use optimized geographic formulas
- Filters are combined using logical AND operations

### Real-time Updates
- Map subscribes to Firestore user stream
- Filters are reapplied automatically when data changes
- Marker updates reflect current filter state

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements:
1. **Server-side Filtering**: Move complex filters to Firestore queries for better performance
2. **Filter Persistence**: Save user's preferred filters across app sessions
3. **Custom Filter Combinations**: Allow more complex filter logic (OR operations)
4. **Geographic Clustering**: Group nearby markers when zoomed out

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Functionality:
1. ✅ Distance filter shows only users within selected radius
2. ✅ User type filter shows appropriate user categories
3. ✅ Category filter shows users with matching item types
4. ✅ Rating filter shows users above minimum trust score
5. ✅ Multiple filters work together (AND logic)
6. ✅ Filter count badge updates correctly
7. ✅ Clear filters restores all users

### Edge Cases:
- Users with missing optional properties (graceful fallbacks)
- Very large distances (should show all users)
- No users matching filter criteria (empty map)
- Filter combinations that exclude all users

## Code Locations

### Key Files Modified:
- `lib/core/services/firebase_location_service.dart` - Enhanced MapUser class
- `lib/features/map/screens/new_map_screen.dart` - Filter logic implementation
- `lib/features/map/widgets/map_filters_bottom_sheet.dart` - Filter UI (existing)
- `lib/core/models/food_item_model.dart` - ItemCategory enum (existing)

The map filtering system is now fully functional and ready for production use with comprehensive filtering capabilities across all user and item attributes.
